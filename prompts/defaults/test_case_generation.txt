Given the following Python code, generate exactly 3 simple test cases.

Code:
```python
{code}
```

Generate exactly 3 simple test cases in the following format:
- Create Python code that calls the main function with 3 different simple inputs
- Keep the test cases straightforward and easy to understand
- Print the results so they can be verified
- Do NOT include any comments in the code

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the test case code, ready to be pasted into the test case window.

DO NOT wrap the code in markdown code blocks. DO NOT include ```python or ``` markers. Return raw Python code only.
